Note Occurences on Significant Beats in Turkish Makam Music:

This study is part of our project in Ethnomusicology at the Master in Sound and Music Computing at University Pompeu Fabra.

Please open the "Makam_Analysis.ipynb" notebook in Google Colab or a Jupyter Notebook in order to look at the code behind the analysis.

The code and plots should already be visible within the notebook, and you need not run the notebook again.

However, in case you would like to run the notebook, please download the SymbTr-2.4.3 dataset from: 
https://github.com/MTG/SymbTr

... and place the extracted folder within this folder. 
Also delete the "makam_dict.json" file, and the notebook should then run smoothly.

Thank you,
Jessica Torrey and Suhit Chiruthapudi.
